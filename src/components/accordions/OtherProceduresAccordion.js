                    <p>A type of lymph node surgery called sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is generally done as part of a lumpectomy or mastectomy for Stages 1, 2, and 3 breast cancer. It isnâ€™t generally done for Stage 0 (ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS) breast cancer.</p>
                    <p>Lymph nodes are often removed during surgery to determine if cancer has spread beyond the breast. The first one or two lymph nodes that a tumor drains into are called sentinel lymph nodes.</p>
                    <p>In an SLNB, the surgeon injects a blue dye or radioactive substance (or both) into the breast to identify the sentinel lymph node(s). The nodes that are stained by the dye or substance with a small amount of radiation (which helps the surgeon find the cancer during surgery using a handheld radiation-detection device) are then removed and checked for cancer cells. Depending on the results, additional lymph node surgery may be needed.
                    </p>
     <p>Some women may develop lymphedema (arm swelling) after lymph node surgery or radiation.</p>

                  <p>Reconstruction is a surgical procedure to restore the shape of the breast after a mastectomy. Reconstruction may be immediate (performed at the same time as your mastectomy) or delayed (a separate surgery done at a later time). Not everyone is a candidate for immediate reconstruction, so discuss your options with your surgeon. Your plastic surgeon will be able to help you decide which type of reconstruction is right for you:</p>

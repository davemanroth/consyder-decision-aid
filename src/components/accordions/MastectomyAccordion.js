              </AccordionItemTitle>
              <AccordionItemBody>
                  <p>Your surgeon may recommend a type of lymph node surgery called sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). This will happen at the same time as your mastectomy. </p>
    <p>Lymph nodes are often removed during surgery to determine if cancer has spread beyond the breast. The first one or two lymph nodes that a tumor drains into are called sentinel lymph nodes.</p>
    <p>In an SLNB, the surgeon injects a blue dye or radioactive substance (or both) into the breast to identify the sentinel lymph node(s). The nodes that are stained by the dye or substance with a small amount of radiation (which helps the surgeon find the cancer during surgery using a handheld radiation-detection device) are then removed and checked for cancer cells. Whether you need additional lymph node surgery will depend on the results of the SLNB and whether you receive radiation after your mastectomy. </p>

              </AccordionItemTitle>
              <AccordionItemBody>
                  <p>There is a risk of surgical complications, such as infection and wound healing problems, which are increased with a more extensive surgery. Complication risks are increased with additional surgery, such as reconstruction.</p>
     <p>Some women may develop lymphedema (arm swelling) after lymph node surgery or radiation.</p>
     <p>Some women who have mastectomies report that their body image and self-image are negatively affected after a mastectomy, even after having breast reconstruction. Some women report that their sexual functioning  is impacted in the years after their mastectomy, including feeling less sexually attractive and less comfortable during sexual intimacy. </p>
     <p>Breastfeeding in the healthy breast will still be possible after a mastectomy.</p>
     <p>After a mastectomy, you will still need a mammogram for the healthy breast.</p>

              <AccordionItemBody>
                  <p>While recovery from a mastectomy is different for everyone, in general, women who have a mastectomy:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Stay overnight at the hospital following their surgery</li>
<li>Can expect to have surgical drains (tubes with a bag attached to capture extra fluid from the surgical site) placed during their surgery to drain extra fluid. This is temporary; your surgeon will take the drains out in about 1 to 2 weeks.</li>
<li>Can usually get back to their regular activities in about 2 to 3 weeks, unless choosing to have reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy, which can prolong the recovery time. Some activities, like exercise, may take longer to get back to.</li>
</ul>

                  <h3>Radiation</h3>
              </AccordionItemTitle>
              <AccordionItemBody>
                  <p>Mastectomy does not eliminate the risk of cancer recurring in the remaining tissues of the chest wall or lymph nodes. In some cases, women who have a mastectomy also have a course of radiation treatment to decrease the risk of cancer returning in the treated breast and chest wall area. Radiation treatment is given to the treated breast area and sometimes to the lymph node regions nearby.</p>
     <p>The radiation treatment usually involves 5 clinical visits each week for 3 to 6 weeks. Each treatment itself is about 10 to 20 minutes. You will not feel anything when you are getting radiation treatment. After the treatment session is over, you can continue your regular activities. It is safe to be around other people after this treatment, including children.</p>
     <p>Most women tolerate radiation treatment well and experience few side effects, but side effects are possible.
<li>Common side effects include sunburn to the chest, irritation or itchiness of the chest skin from the radiation, and fatigue.</li>
<li>Most side effects from radiation treatment are short term.</li>

              </AccordionItemTitle>
              <AccordionItemBody>
                  <p>After a mastectomy, the risk of the breast cancer returning in the treated breast and chest wall area over the next 5 years is about 2 to 4%. This means that, on average, about 2 to 4 of every 100 women who choose this treatment for their breast cancer will have their breast cancer come back in their treated breast and chest wall area. </p>

                  </BrcaAccordion>
                  <p>After a mastectomy, the risk of breast cancer developing in the healthy (other) breast in the next 5 years is about 2 to 3%. This means that, on average, about 2 to 3 of every 100 women who choose this treatment for their breast cancer will develop cancer in their healthy breast.</p>
                 
    <BrcaAccordion>
                      <p>For women with a BRCA1 mutation, after a mastectomy, the risk of the breast cancer developing in the healthy breast in the next 5 years is about 14 to 15%. This means that, on average, about 14 to 15 of every 100 women who choose this treatment for their breast cancer will develop cancer in their healthy breast.</p>

<p>For women with a BRCA2 mutation, after a mastectomy, the risk of the breast cancer developing in the healthy breast in the next 5 years is about 4 to 9%. This means that, on average, about 4 to 9 of every 100 women who choose this treatment for their breast cancer will develop cancer in their healthy breast

              </AccordionItemTitle>
              <AccordionItemBody>
                  <p>Because your surgeon will be removing the breast tissue right up to the skin of the breast, the sensory nerves are affected, and most women have permanent numbness in the breast and chest wall and nipple area of the treated breast (from your collarbone to the top of your rib cage on the side with the tumor). </p>
     <p>The surgery will leave scars on the breast skin that will fade over time. </p>
     <p>Some women choose to have breast reconstruction to help restore the look and feel of the breast that was removed. Reconstruction may be done at the same time as the mastectomy (immediate) or later (delayed). Learn more about breast reconstruction.</p>
     <p>Women who do not have breast reconstruction may choose to be fitted for a breast prosthesis (or breast form made of silicone gel, foam, or other materials) that can be placed in a bra and worn under clothes. Learn more about a prosthesis. </p>
     <p>Some women don’t want additional surgery or to deal with special bras, magnets, or adhesive patches that hold a prosthesis in place. They choose no reconstruction and don’t wear a breast form most of the time. </p>
     <p>The decision to reconstruct or not is very personal. There is no “right way” to approach mastectomy and reconstruction (or lack of it). There is only the way that is best for you, your preferences, and your healing. </p>

                      <p>Bilateral (double) mastectomy is a surgical procedure in which both breasts are removed (the breast with the tumor and the healthy breast).</p>

                          <AccordionItemBody>
                              <p>There is a risk of surgical complications, such as infection and wound healing problems, which is increased with a more extensive surgery, such as a bilateral mastectomy vs a unilateral mastectomy. Complication risks are increased with additional surgery, such as reconstruction. One study found that that undergoing a bilateral mastectomy is associated with a significantly higher risk for certain complications when compared with a unilateral mastectomy. These include a higher risk of needing a blood transfusion and a re-operation, and a longer hospital stay, although the rate of major complications for both types of mastectomy remains low.</p>
    <p>Some women who have mastectomies report that their body image and self-image are negatively affected after a mastectomy, even after having breast reconstruction. Some women report that their sexual functioning is impacted in the years after their mastectomy, including feeling less sexually attractiveness and less comfortable during sexual intimacy.  </p>
    <p>Breastfeeding will not be possible after a bilateral mastectomy.</p>
    <p>If you have a bilateral mastectomy, you will not need mammograms in the future.</p>

                              <p>The recovery time from a bilateral mastectomy can vary from person to person, but because it is a more extensive surgery than a unilateral mastectomy, recovery is longer for a bilateral mastectomy. In general, women who have a bilateral mastectomy:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Stay overnight at the hospital following their surgery</li> 
<li>Can expect to have surgical drains (tubes with a bag attached to capture extra fluid from the surgical site) placed during their surgery to drain extra fluid. This is temporary; your surgeon will take the drains out in about 2 to 4 weeks.</li>

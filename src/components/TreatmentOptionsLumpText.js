  <div>
		<p><strong>Lumpectomy</strong> is a surgical procedure that removes the tumor, usually with some additional noncancerous tissue around it, but otherwise leaves the breast intact. You may also hear lumpectomy called breast-conserving surgery or breast-conserving treatment, partial mastectomy, or wide excision.</p> 
		<p>The surgery lasts about an hour.</p>
		<p>After a lumpectomy, additional surgery may be needed if the surgeon does not get an area around the tumor that is clear of cancer cells (called a "clear margin") and needs to take out more tissue to get a clear margin.</p>
